Tried this wkflw:
- open img in photoshop
- trace drawings in black
- export > layers to files
    - this has option for type
    - BMP
        - not necessarily smaller size
    - PNG
        - has option for trim layer (not what we want cuz then there is a misalignment)
        - has option for "interlaced" (not sure what this is)
            - interlaced is like built-in LOD
            - initial test shows size increase 9->11, 11->15
        - tried png-24 which was much bigger0
        - yeah, these end up being like 8 kb

Image processing
- I think the masks is gonna werk out aight
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing
- We can probs use this ere 'destination-in'
- ctx.globalCompositeOperation = type;

so I guess we gonna canvas
